‚úÖ Features of this **Terminal-style README**:  
- Looks like a real Linux/Mac terminal  
- Commands like `whoami`, `cat`, `ls`, `pwd`  
- Projects displayed as directories  
- Journey, skills, learning, and fun facts in command format  
- Clean, professional, and fully unique  

---

If you want, I can **upgrade this version with color-coded commands, ASCII banners, and ‚Äúanimated typing‚Äù style** to make it look **like an actual interactive terminal** on GitHub ‚Äî extremely rare and impressive.  

Do you want me to do that next?
